# School Management System (M.E.R.N)

A modular system for academic scheduling, attendance, payroll, and more.  Student Management

## Overview

This is a full-stack MERN application that allows for student management. The project contains both a **frontend** built with React and a **backend** built with Node.js and Express. The frontend and backend are configured to run concurrently.

---

## Core Features

Flexible Academic Calendar (Semester/Trimester/Quarter).

Subject → Course → Class hierarchy with room/teacher assignment.

Role-based access (Teachers, Nurses, Admin).

Attendance, Notes, Payroll, and Extracurriculars.

## Setup Guide

# 1. Configure Academic Timeline

### Step 1: Create a School Year

Fields: start_date, end_date, active, calendar_type (Semester/Trimester/Quarter).

### Step  2: Add Periods

 ```
Example for Semesters:

Period 1: "Fall 2025" (Sep-Dec)

Period 2: "Spring 2026" (Jan-May)
 ```

# 2. Define Subjects & Courses

- Subjects are containers for courses:

subject_id, name, grade_level, department, duration (Year/Semester).

- Courses are instances of subjects:

course_id, subject_id, period_id (links to Semester 1/2), prerequisites.

 ```
Example:

Subject: Mathematics (Grade 10, Year-long)

Course 1: Algebra 101 (Semester 1)

Course 2: Geometry 102 (Semester 2)
 ```

# 3. Schedule Classes

- For each Course, create Classes:

class_id, course_id, room_id (auto-checks capacity), time_slot, teacher_id.

-- Rules:

Rooms can’t be double-booked for the same time.

Teachers can’t teach overlapping classes.

# 4. Assign Students & Track Data

Enrollment: Link student_id to class_id.

Attendance: Per-class, recorded by teachers.

-- Notes: Tagged by role (e.g., nurse notes are medical-only).

# 5. Payroll & Extras
Salaries: Base pay + extracurricular bonuses.

--- Extracurriculars: Treated like courses but flagged is_extracurricular=True.

# 🎨 Visual Examples

## 1. Subject/Course Timeline

 ```
Mathematics (Grade 10, Year-long)
├── Semester 1: Algebra 101
│   ├── Class A: Mon/Wed 9 AM (Room 2B) 
│   └── Class B: Tue/Thu 1 PM (Room 3A)
└── Semester 2: Geometry 102
    └── Class A: Mon/Fri 10 AM (Room 2B)
     ```

## 2. Room Booking Conflict Check

     ```
Room	Time	Monday	Tuesday
2B	9:00-10:30	Algebra 101	Available
2B	11:00-12:30	Available	Physics 201
     ```

Visual Workflow Example
Admin sets up:

School Year: "2025-2026" → Trimesters.

Subjects: "Science" → Courses: "Biology 101" (Trimester 1), "Chemistry 101" (Trimester 2).

Room: "Lab 3A" (Capacity: 24 → auto-limits max_students in classes).

Teacher assigns:

Class: "Biology 101 - Section A" (Mon/Wed 10 AM, Lab 3A).

Logs attendance daily; adds notes (e.g., "Student A needs lab safety retraining").

Nurse adds:

Confidential note: "Student B: Allergy to latex (in Science Lab)".

Payroll auto-calculates:

Teacher salary + bonus for extracurricular supervision.

Key Features:
Flexible Academic Calendar: Switch between semesters/trimesters without data loss.

Room-Driven Constraints: Classes can’t exceed room capacity; time-slot conflicts flagged.

Role-Specific Access: Nurses see medical notes; teachers see attendance.

Extracurricular Tracking: Separate from academic courses but uses same room/teacher systems.

## Initial Setup

Follow these steps to get your environment up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

## Files to Delete If No Longer Needed

If there are files that are no longer necessary in either the frontend or backend, here's a list of common files to delete:

### **Frontend:**

If no longer needed, delete:


- **Unnecessary Components**: If you have components that aren't being used, you can delete them from `frontend/src/components/`.

  Example:

  - `frontend/src/components/Header.jsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/Footer.jsx`

- **Unused Pages**: If you have page components that aren't being used, you can delete them from `frontend/src/pages/`.

  Example:

  - `frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx`

- **CSS or Styles**: If you've removed specific styles or no longer need them, delete the corresponding CSS files from `frontend/src/`.

  Example:

  - `frontend/src/index.css`

### **Backend:**

If no longer needed, delete:

- **Unused Routes or Controllers**: Remove unnecessary route files or controllers from `backend/src/routes/` or `backend/src/controllers/`.

  Example:

  - `backend/src/routes/studentRoutes.js`
  - `backend/src/controllers/studentController.js`

- **Models**: Delete any unused models from `backend/src/models/`.

  Example:

  - `backend/src/models/studentModel.js`

- **Middleware**: If you've created middleware that's no longer in use, delete it from `backend/src/middleware/`.

  Example:

  - `backend/src/middleware/authMiddleware.js`

- **Unused Config Files**: Delete any unused configuration files or settings in `backend/src/config/`.

---

## Useful Commands

- **Start the Backend**:

  ```
  npm run server
  ```

- **Start the Frontend**:

  ```
  npm run client
  ```

- **Start both Backend and Frontend concurrently**:

  ```
  npm run start
  ```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **If the backend server doesn't start**: Ensure you have `nodemon` installed and configured for automatic server restarts.

- **If the frontend doesn't load**: Check the `frontend/package.json` for the correct start script and make sure the frontend dependencies are installed correctly.
